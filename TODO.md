# TODOs

-	add local `node_modules/.bin` to PATH for both the command and taskfile version
-	make access to members of modules more uniform. For example TASKS.Task is a bit strange.
- 	use es6 style export and import
-  put the global collection variable in main.js
-	make tests for the `main.js` methods that actually test results.
